* xsv.el
xsv.el is a front end for CSV toolkit [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv][xsv]]. xsv provides very powerful ways to
work with CSV file and xsv.el brings that awesomeness into Emacs.

* installation
For now, either clone the repo and add to load-path or use package manager like straight.

* Why
Emacs has CSV mode to work with CSV files, it has nice things but I find it
lacking certain functionality I want and I have to resort to Numbers/Excel from
time to time.

After I discovered the xsv, I realize it could bridge the gap I encountered before.

Some examples are:
- I want to filter the csv file to show only rows where certain columns match my criteria
- I want to only view columns I'm interested

xsv provides much more functionalities than I need, but I think I will bring in more and
more into the package to make it even more useful.
